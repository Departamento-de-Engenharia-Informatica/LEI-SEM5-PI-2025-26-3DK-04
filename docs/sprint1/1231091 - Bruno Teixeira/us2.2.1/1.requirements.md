# US 2.2.1 - Create and Update Vessel Types

## 1. Requirements

### 1.1. User Story

**As a Port Authority Officer**, I want to create and update vessel types, so that vessels can be classified consistently and their operational constraints are properly defined.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications
**Clarifications:**

- "A different vessel type has, naturally, a different description. But, this doesn't mean that descriptions of vessel types are unique."
- **Q**: The vessel type defines the dimensions, capacity and cargo disposition of all vessels of that type or is some variation possible within the same type?
    **A**: For simplicity, you should consider that no variation is possible.
- **Q**: And which are the max dimensions and cargo disposition for each type?
    **A**: Such dimensions are defined by the user, i.e., the Port Authority Officer.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- Vessel types must include attributes such as name, description, capacity, and operational constraints (e.g.: maximum number of rows, bays, and tiers).
