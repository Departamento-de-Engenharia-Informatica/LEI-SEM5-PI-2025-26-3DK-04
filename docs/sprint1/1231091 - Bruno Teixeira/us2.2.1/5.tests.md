## 5. Tests

### 5.1. Unit Tests
- **Test Create Valid Vessel Type:**
    - Verify that a new vessel type with valid data (name, description, capacity, operational constraints) can be successfully created.
    - Ensure the vessel type record is persisted.
    - Confirm returned DTO has expected fields.

- **Test Create Vessel Type with Duplicate Name:**
    - Attempt to create a vessel type using a name already in use.
    - System should reject the operation and return a validation error (BusinessRuleValidationException).

- **Test Create Vessel Type with Invalid Values:**
    - Verify system rejects vessel types with zero or negative capacity.
    - Verify system rejects vessel types with zero or negative operational constraints (rows, bays, tiers).
    - Ensure proper error messages are returned for each invalid field.

- **Test Update Vessel Type Successfully:**
    - Retrieve an existing vessel type.
    - Update its properties (name, capacity, operational constraints).
    - Verify changes are persisted and returned in the DTO.

- **Test Update Non-Existing Vessel Type:**
    - Attempt to update a vessel type with an ID that doesn't exist.
    - System should return null (controller translates to 404 Not Found).

- **Test Search Vessel Types by Name:**
    - Create multiple vessel types with different names.
    - Search by partial name match.
    - Verify correct vessel types are returned.

- **Test Search Vessel Types by Description:**
    - Create vessel types with different descriptions.
    - Search by description term.
    - Verify correct results are returned.


### 5.2. Functional Tests
- **Test Vessel Type Creation via UI:**
    - Officer logs in with Port Authority credentials.
    - Officer navigates to "Create Vessel Type".
    - Officer fills in vessel type details (name, description, capacity, operational constraints).
    - System validates inputs and confirms creation.
    - Verify new vessel type appears in vessel type list.

- **Test Error on Missing Required Fields:**
    - Attempt to create vessel type with missing name or capacity.
    - System displays validation errors and prevents submission.

- **Test Duplicate Name Prevention:**
    - Try to create vessel type with existing name.
    - System blocks and displays error message.

- **Test Vessel Type Update via UI:**
    - Officer selects an existing vessel type.
    - Officer updates vessel type data.
    - System validates and saves changes.
    - Verify updated vessel type reflects changes.

- **Test Search Functionality:**
    - Officer uses search to find vessel types by name or description.
    - Verify search returns correct filtered results.
