## 5. Tests

### 5.1. Unit Tests
- **Test Create Valid Vessel:**
    - Verify that a new vessel with valid data (IMO number, name, operator, call sign, vessel type, flag, length, width) can be successfully created.
    - Ensure IMO number is validated (7 digits with valid checksum).
    - Confirm the vessel record is persisted.
    - Ensure returned DTO contains expected fields.

- **Test Create Vessel with Invalid IMO:**
    - Attempt to create a vessel with invalid IMO number (wrong format, invalid checksum).
    - System should reject the operation and return a validation error.

- **Test Create Vessel with Duplicate IMO:**
    - Attempt to create a vessel using an IMO already in the system.
    - System should reject and return a validation error (BusinessRuleValidationException).

- **Test Create Vessel with Non-Existent Vessel Type:**
    - Attempt to create a vessel referencing a vessel type ID that doesn't exist.
    - System should reject the operation with appropriate error message.

- **Test Update Vessel Successfully:**
    - Retrieve an existing vessel.
    - Update its properties (operator, call sign, flag, dimensions).
    - Verify changes are persisted and returned in the DTO.

- **Test Update Vessel Operator:**
    - Change the operator name for an existing vessel.
    - System should allow update and persist the change.
    - Verify the updated operator appears in the returned DTO.

- **Test Update Non-Existing Vessel:**
    - Attempt to update a vessel with an ID that doesn't exist.
    - System should return null (controller translates to 404 Not Found).

- **Test Search Vessels by IMO:**
    - Create multiple vessels with different IMOs.
    - Search by IMO number.
    - Verify correct vessel is returned.

- **Test Search Vessels by Operator:**
    - Create vessels with different operators.
    - Search by operator name.
    - Verify correct vessels are returned.


### 5.2. Functional Tests
- **Test Vessel Registration via UI:**
    - Officer logs in with Port Authority credentials.
    - Officer navigates to "Register Vessel".
    - Officer fills in vessel details (IMO, name, operator, call sign, vessel type, flag, dimensions).
    - System validates IMO format and checksum.
    - System confirms vessel type exists.
    - System confirms creation and displays success message.
    - Verify new vessel appears in vessel list.

- **Test Error on Invalid IMO Format:**
    - Attempt to register vessel with IMO not matching 7-digit format.
    - System displays validation error and prevents submission.

- **Test Error on Invalid IMO Checksum:**
    - Attempt to register vessel with valid format but invalid checksum.
    - System displays error message.

- **Test Duplicate IMO Prevention:**
    - Try to register vessel with IMO already registered.
    - System blocks and displays error message.

- **Test Missing Required Fields:**
    - Attempt to create vessel without required fields (IMO, name, vessel type).
    - System displays validation errors and prevents submission.

- **Test Vessel Update via UI:**
    - Officer selects an existing vessel.
    - Officer updates vessel data (operator, call sign, flag).
    - System validates and saves changes.
    - Verify updated vessel reflects changes.

- **Test Search Functionality:**
    - Officer uses search to find vessels by IMO or operator.
    - Verify search returns correct filtered results.
